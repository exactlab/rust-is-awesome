# Traits 

Traits are a way to define a common behaviour (a set of methods) that types can implement.  
Grouping sets of methods into traits is very convenient for generic programming and let programmers to create clear interfaces that are clear and easy to maintain.  
In fact this concept is refered to as "interface" in languages such as Java and C#.   
In C++ the same effect is achieved by base classes (exposing a certain interface) and making our types derive from them (implementation).

```bash
cargo run 
```
