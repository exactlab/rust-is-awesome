# Generics

Generic programming is a very effective way to write only once code than is able to adapt to many types. 
We basically write a blue-print for functions and objects and then the compiler uses that blue-print in order to instatiate different versions of code, 
one for each type.  
Basically we delegate the boring (and error-prone) part (writing the same logic many times) to the compiler, while keeping the fun part for us.

### For C++ coders
This is a very well known concept to C++ programmers as template programming (STL stands for template standard library).  
In order to implement trait-bounds usually C++ programmers employ meta-programming.
Nowadays template meta-programming is less needed in C++ thanks to concepts.
